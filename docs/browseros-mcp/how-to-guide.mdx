BrowserOS runs as an MCP server, letting Claude control your browser directlyâ€”open tabs, scrape data, fill forms, and more.

## How to use `BrowserOS-mcp` on Claude Code

1. Download binary from [BrowserOS.com](https://BrowserOS.com)
2. Open BrowserOS and open a new tab. Click the settings icon in the top right corner to open the settings page.
3. From the settings page, navigate to **MCP** in the sidebar and copy the MCP URL
4. In your terminal, type: `claude mcp add --transport http browseros http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp` (Replace `<port>` with your port number, usually `9225`)
5. Now start Claude Code: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` (so Claude doesn't ask for confirmation each time)
6. You can now type `Open amazon.com on browseros` on claude-code and it should open the tab in BrowserOS!

## How to add `BrowserOS-mcp` on Claude Desktop

1. Download binary from [BrowserOS.com](https://BrowserOS.com)

3. Open your Claude Desktop config file: `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
4. Add BrowserOS to your config (replace the port with the value shown in MCP settings page):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browserOS": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp"]
