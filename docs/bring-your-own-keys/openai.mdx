# OpenAI

OpenAI provides access to GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and other powerful AI models that can help with a wide range of tasks from coding to creative writing.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring OpenAI with BrowserOS, you'll need:
- An OpenAI account
- API access enabled
- Your API key from the OpenAI platform

## Getting your API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to "API keys" in the sidebar
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Name your key (e.g., "BrowserOS")
6. Copy and securely store the key immediately (it won't be shown again)

## Configuration

### Step 1: Open BrowserOS Settings

1. Launch BrowserOS
2. Click on the settings icon in the toolbar
3. Navigate to "AI Configuration"

### Step 2: Add OpenAI

1. Select "Add AI Provider"
2. Choose "OpenAI" from the list
3. Enter your API key
4. Select your preferred model:
   - **GPT-4 Turbo**: Latest and most capable (128K context)
   - **GPT-4**: Original GPT-4 model
   - **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: Fast and cost-effective
   - **GPT-4 Vision**: For image analysis tasks

### Step 3: Configure Parameters

- **Max Tokens**: Maximum response length (default: 4096)
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness (0.0-2.0, default: 0.7)
- **Top P**: Alternative to temperature for sampling (0.0-1.0)
- **Frequency Penalty**: Reduce repetition (-2.0 to 2.0)
- **Presence Penalty**: Encourage topic diversity (-2.0 to 2.0)

### Step 4: Test Connection

Click "Test Connection" to verify your API key and settings.

## Usage

Once configured, you can:
- Generate and refactor code
- Create detailed technical documentation
- Analyze and summarize documents
- Build automation agents with natural language
- Get coding assistance and debugging help

## Advanced Features

### Function Calling
- Enable structured outputs for agent creation
- Define custom functions for automated tasks
- Integrate with external APIs

### Fine-tuning Support
If you have fine-tuned models:
1. Enter your custom model ID
2. Select "Custom Model" from the model dropdown
3. Input your fine-tuned model name

### Assistants API
- Use OpenAI Assistants for persistent conversations
- Enable code interpreter for data analysis
- Access file search capabilities

## Pricing

OpenAI uses a pay-per-token pricing model:
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: $0.01/1K input, $0.03/1K output tokens
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: $0.0005/1K input, $0.0015/1K output tokens
- Check [OpenAI pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) for current rates

## Usage Limits

### Rate Limits
- Vary based on your account tier
- Monitor usage in the OpenAI dashboard
- Consider batching requests for efficiency

### Token Limits
- GPT-4 Turbo: 128,000 tokens
- GPT-4: 8,192 or 32,768 tokens
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: 16,385 tokens

## Best Practices

1. **Model Selection**:
   - Use GPT-3.5 Turbo for simple, fast tasks
   - Choose GPT-4 for complex reasoning
   - Use GPT-4 Vision for image-related tasks

2. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Set appropriate max token limits
   - Use streaming for long responses
   - Cache common queries locally

3. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Be specific and detailed
   - Use system messages for consistent behavior
   - Provide examples for complex tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid API Key
- Ensure the key starts with "sk-"
- Verify the key hasn't been deleted or rotated
- Check that billing is set up on your OpenAI account

### Rate Limiting
```
Error: Rate limit exceeded
```
- Wait for the cooldown period
- Upgrade your OpenAI plan
- Implement exponential backoff

### Billing Issues
- Add payment method to OpenAI account
- Check usage limits haven't been exceeded
- Monitor costs in the OpenAI dashboard

### Model Access
- GPT-4 requires specific account access
- Some models may have waitlists
- Verify model availability in your region

## Security Note

Your API key is encrypted and stored locally. All requests are sent directly to OpenAI's servers via HTTPS, ensuring data security and privacy.
