### Step 3: Copy your key

Copy the key that appears. Keep it safe - you won't be able to see it again.

## Configure BrowserOS

Click the settings icon in BrowserOS, then click **USE** on the OpenAI card. Paste your API key and configure the settings based on your chosen model. For GPT-4.1, set **Context Window Size** to `128000` and check **Supports Images**. Click **Save**.
