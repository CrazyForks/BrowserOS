## Why We're Building BrowserOS

For the first time since Netscape pioneered the web in 1994, AI gives us the chance to completely reimagine the browser. We've seen tools like Cursor deliver 10x productivity gains for developers‚Äîyet everyday browsing remains frustratingly archaic.

You're likely juggling 70+ tabs, battling your browser instead of having it assist you. Routine tasks, like "reorder Tide Pods from my Amazon history," should be handled seamlessly by intelligent AI agents.

At BrowserOS, we're convinced that AI should empower you by automating tasks locally and securely‚Äîkeeping your data private. We are building the best browser for this future!

## How we compare

<details>
<summary><b>vs Chrome</b></summary>
<br>
While we're grateful for Google open-sourcing Chromium, but Chrome hasn't evolved much in 10 years. No AI features, no automation, no MCP support.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Brave</b></summary>
<br>
We love what Brave started, but they've spread themselves too thin with crypto, search, VPNs. We're laser-focused on AI-powered browsing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Arc/Dia</b></summary>
<br>
Many loved Arc, but it was closed source. When they abandoned users, there was no recourse. We're 100% open source - fork it anytime!
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Perplexity Comet</b></summary>
<br>
They're a search/ad company. Your browser history becomes their product. We keep everything local.
</details>
